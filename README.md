# Unsupervised Machine Learning
* class at Roux
* Storing codes for hw solutions.

## setup
* Use 'git' and 'make' packages in terminal to run the source codes as instructed here.
* There is a [instruction](https://github.com/ds5110/git-intro?tab=readme-ov-file) of how to set up 'git' and 'make'

## hw 01

* Type following command to the command line to see the result of 3 different algorithms of k-mean clustering:
```
make hw01
```

* Source code in Colab version with the plots can be found in the [repo](src/K_mean_cluster.ipynb) or [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IqTUJfrh7rDw8AOPhbA2V1e5G6YI0kym)


## hw 02

* Type following command to the command line to see the plots for homework 02:
```
make hw02
```

* Source code in Colab version with the plots can be found in the [repo](src/hw2_Clustering.ipynb) or [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10RqQOOFVNMIAN5hCuXpT1HW81cBiERbf#scrollTo=GAj-x2hB5DV3)
